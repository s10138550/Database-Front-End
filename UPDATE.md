# Database-Front-End

11/6/2020 

Successfully migrated. Was missing a primary key for the Product.cs. Added a new expression public long Id { get; set; }
on line 10.

We have successfully created the user interfaces and created a table for our database.  We left off on page 81 of the tutorial Listing 50. 
There was a problem at first with line 18 with expression PathAndQuery but fixed it.
